    <h1>ECMAScript examples - Read HTML for instructions</h1>

    <p>HINT 1: Remove and add comments in the source code of this HTML file to activate ONLY 1 file
        at time. Move those comment "teminators" to change which script is active, which is not.
    </p>

    <p>HINT 2: Open browser console. Put debugger break point at least at the end of the file. Refresh. Sometimes you might
        put in the beginning as well, to follow some process.
    </p>

    <p>HINT 3: Use VS Code. Then links in source code become clickable.

    <h3>Steps in learning</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Read a small piece of the example code, don't worry if don't understand or don't understand all.</li>
        <li>Write under the example the same in your own code, possibly first 100% similar to the example. Peek as little as possible. Naturally you cannot use same names foo/bar/a/b/c/d/e, thus use e.g. huu/haa/v/w/x/y/z to avoid name clashes</li>
        <li>Change it if need to learn it deeper. Try if it still works like you think</li>
        <li>If need to learn something even better, make your own similar example</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
       (SORRY: It's not possible to put them inside functions and call them from buttons, as then
        global scope would turn into function scope which would ruin _some_ of the 
        demonstrated effects. So manual commenting and uncommenting needed.)
